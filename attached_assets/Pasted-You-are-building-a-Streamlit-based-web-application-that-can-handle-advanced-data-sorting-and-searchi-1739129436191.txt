You are building a Streamlit-based web application that can handle advanced data sorting and searching. The app will allow users to upload multiple TXT files, store them in a PostgreSQL database, and retrieve specific data using advanced search filters. The project should support Bangla text compatibility.

Features & Functionalities
1. Data Upload & Storage
A dedicated upload page where users can upload multiple TXT files at once.
Users must provide a batch name when uploading. The uploaded files will be stored under a folder named after the batch.
The PostgreSQL database will store the extracted data from the TXT files.
Each file should be organized under its batch name, and the system should maintain the file structure in the database.
2. Advanced Search & Filtering
A search page where users can search for records using various fields:
SI Number
Name
Father’s Name
Mother’s Name
Occupation
Address
Date of Birth
The system should retrieve and display the relevant records.
Bangla text should be searchable.
A button next to the search box that displays all stored records.
3. Data Organization & Viewing
An "All Data" page to view stored data:
Folder-wise structure: Users can click on a folder (batch name) to view the TXT files within.
Clicking on a file should display its stored data.
4. Data Analysis
A data analysis page that provides reports on:
Total records available.
Occupation-wise data distribution, displayed folder-wise.
Clicking on a folder should show occupation-specific data analysis.
5. Friend & Enemy Categorization
Every search result card will have two buttons:
Friend → Marks the record as a "Friend" and adds it to a separate Friend List.
Enemy → Marks the record as an "Enemy" and adds it to a separate Enemy List.
A new page will be created to view Friend List and Enemy List, displayed folder-wise.
6. Additional Features
Edit Feature: Allow editing of individual records from search results.
Delete Feature: Enable deleting individual records from search results.
Delete All Feature: Add an option to delete all stored data in the "All Data" page.
File Name Display: Each search result should display the file name where the record is stored.
Technical Requirements
Framework: Streamlit (Python-based UI)
Database: PostgreSQL (for storage)
Authentication & Data Processing: Use provided auth.py and data_processor.py files.
